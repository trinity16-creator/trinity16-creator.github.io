<h1 style="font-family:verdana;">Doggos and Puppers</h1>
<p>Dogs are generally classified into two sub-classes: Doggos and Puppers. Doggos are bigger
dogs that may seem big and scary but are actually cute fluffballs that deserved
to be loved by everyone. Puppers are smaller dogs that are usually known to
associated with fluffy cotton ball dogs, but this not non-inclusive of other small
dogs. If you look just below, you'll see a cute doggo with phat glasses and a
black sweater on doing a sleep on a good book.</p>

<h2 style="font-family:verdana; font-size:150%">Synopsis of Doggo Lingo</h2>
<p id="lastParagraph">DoggoLingo, also referred to as woof, bork and dog-speak, is an internet
language trend that is created from word conversion, meme lexicon, and onomatopoeia.
DoggoLingo is implied to be a dog's own idiom, and is presented as what humans have
long believed goes on in the canine brain. Elyse Graham, assistant professor at
Stony Brook University, <u>describes DoggoLingo as "upbeat, joyful, and clueless in
a relentlessly friendly way".</u>

<h3 style="font-family:verdana;">Structure</h3>
<p id="structure">DoggoLingo appends various suffixes <span style="background-color:yellow">
"-o", "-er", "-ino"</span> to existing English
words <span style="background-color:yellow">(i.e. dog turns into doggo, pup
turns into pupper)</span> and DoggoLingo words
that have been created <span style="background-color:yellow">(i.e. pupper turns
into pupperino, bork turns into borker).</span>
DoggoLingo relies heavily upon onomatopoeia. Words such as blep, blop and mlem,
that describe the action of a dog sticking out its tongue. Also, bork, boof,
woof to describe the various canine barking sounds. DoggoLingo is simplistic
and also creates words based upon the appearance of a canine. For example, a
dog with a fluffy coat would be called a floof or a fluff depending upon the
furs visual texture. The DoggoLingo follows the same rudimentary style to create
its verbs <span style="background-color:yellow">(i.e. doin me a in place of the verb to do) and adjectives
(i.e heckin in place of the adjective extremely).</span>

<h4 style="font-family:verdana; font-size:150%">Origin</h4>
<p>The exact origin of DoggoLingo is unknown. Various social media accounts such
as WeRateDogs (Twitter), Dogspotting (Facebook), as well as social news aggregation
and imageboard websites like 4chan, Reddit, or Tumblr have aided in popularising
the use of DoggoLingo by consistently using or hosting content that uses the
lingo on their Internet pages. In 2014, the Dogspotting Facebook account gained
popularity, especially in Australia where coincidentally adding "-o" to the end
of words is also a feature of Australian slang.</p>
